# Simple Item Calculator
This is my first flutter project ðŸ˜Š, initially developed to assist in volunteering as a librarian at a nation-wide christian conference. This app can be generalized to assist any vendor/cashier in calculating and revising orders.

# Screenshots

The main view of the app, a scrollable list of items where each item's count can be increased or decreased using the - and + buttons. The bottom floating buttons from left to right are editing (add/remove items), reset order, and receipt view.
